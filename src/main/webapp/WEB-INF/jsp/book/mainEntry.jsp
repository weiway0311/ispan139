      <h1>Reveal on Scroll</h1>
      <p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!</p>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

      <p>That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.</p>

      <p>Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.</p>

      <p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</p>

      <p>Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.</p>

      <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

      <p>Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.</p>

      <p>The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!</p>

      <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
